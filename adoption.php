	      		<h5>The Ultimutt Animal Rescue strives to find permanent homes for every adoptable animal in our care. 
	      		In order to achieve this goal, our application process collects information about you and your lifestyle
	      		in an effort to properly match you with an ideal pet. We do not mean to be intrusive in any way, and our 
	      		process is in the best interest of you AND our animals. We are here to be a resource in helping you meet your match!</h5>

			<div id="column1"><h2>Adoption Procedure</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Visit our shelter at 3040 Holland Road. If you find an animal you are interested in, 
				    information can be found on the cage card attached to the kennel. If your lifestyle fits 
				    the needs of the pet, ask a cattery or kennel technician to assist you. They will remove 
				    the animal from the cage and escort you to a visitation room.</li>
				<li>Spend some time interacting with the animal outside the cage. Ask questions. Be sure this is the right animal for you.</li>
				<li>If you would like to fill out an application for the animal, let your technician know. They’ll get you started.
				<li>Take the completed application to the front desk for review.</li>
				<li>All household members must visit with the animal before the adoption can be finalized.</li>
				<li>Anyone wishing to adopt a dog or puppy who currently has a dog or puppy at home must do a dog introduction at the shelter. 
			    	    This is arranged AFTER the vet and residence check have been completed.</li>
				<li>All animals adopted from the Ultimutt Animal Rescue will be spayed or neutered. After surgery, you will attend a brief post-op care class. 
			   	    After class, your animal will be released to you.</li>
				<li>You must have a collar and leash for your adopted dog or a collar and carrier for your new cat/kitten before leaving the shelter. 
			    	    You can bring these items with you at the time of pick-up or you can purchase them from the Ultimutt Animal Rescue.</li>
			</ol>
